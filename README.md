# Lab02SNAPS
Second lab in CS 235, taking information on students, classes, and their schedules and outputting data.
"Class design is type design. Defining effective classes can be challenging. For this lab you are to design classes for a school database with has-a and is-a relationships that have natural syntax, intuitive semantics, and efficient memory allocation. The class objects are populated from parsed input strings. Use object inheritance, polymorphism, and function and operator overloading where needed. All member data and internal functions are private. All classes have a "toString" method with friends for the insertion ("<<") operator."
